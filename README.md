# Tour de France challenge
Personal fitness challenge for when the Tour De France is on - I cycle 10% of the distance


Every year I set myself the challenge of cycling 10% of the distance, over the same period as the race.

I keep track in a spreadsheet, which i make a copy of each year, and update the stage dates and distances.

10% is the right distance for me, but it's easy to make it a different %, or do a different sport - eg running or swimming.
